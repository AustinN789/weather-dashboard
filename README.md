## Note

Initially, I encountered difficulties with this project, particularly with registering for the API key and developing the JavaScript component. To overcome this, I examined various weather dashboard projects created by others. By utilizing their code as a reference, I was able to navigate through this challenge more effectively. Learning through observation of others' work has been immensely helpful, especially as I continue to enhance my Java skills. Observing how others approach coding provides valuable insights, and it inspires me to innovate and create a unique version of the project.
